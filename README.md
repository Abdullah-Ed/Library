# Library

I encountered several challenges while working on this project, and I unintentionally overcomplicated certain aspects that should have been straightforward. As you can see from the changes history, I had to rewrite everything multiple times. One of the main issues I faced was finding an effective way to update the array and simultaneously refresh the display. A simple solution to this problem would involve modifying the array and then re-rendering the display.
